            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>edious Reflections on my ſhort Sermon in behalf of Charity, and my moſt earneſt and humble Petition for a Brotherly Conference. I have ſtudied our SAVIOUR's Sermon on the Mount, and I hope I have profited ſomething at His School, who when He was Reviled, Reviled not again, my Intention is not to amuſe the World with Parades, unbecoming a Churchman, nor to do any thing that may purchaſe me the Character of a <hi>Sounding Braſs,</hi> or <hi>Tinkling Cymbal:</hi> I have read the Cauſes of the decay of Chriſtian Piety, and other good Books written in good Language, but I was never at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> nor am I verſed in its rude Dialect: I know how <hi>Haman</hi> pleaded againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Fauning Orator <hi>Tertullus,</hi> againſt the great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Rapturous Encomiaſt on Heavenly Charity; I know alſo how the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> managed the Contraverſie betwixt him and a very ill Competitor: But I never thought it worth my while, to beſtow ſpare hours on ſuch traſh &amp; dirty pamphlets, as the <hi>Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> and the <hi>Wicked Anſwers</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>I have long been one of theſe Mourners who bewail the ſad State of Chriſtendom, and the miſerable Diviſions of this Kingdom in particular, and the fierce Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties among Us Churchmen, which make the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> flout Us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Theiſt</hi> and <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> lift up his Head, and the <hi>Romiſh Miſſionary</hi> bleſs himſelf with ſwelling Hopes and Triumph in Secret, and warm himſelf at the fire kindled in Our Bowels.</p>
            <p>I have been ſometime in this Place, at the deſire of Perſons of different Ranks and Characters, who are enclined to hope, that as upon more Occaſions than one, I have conform to my Slender Capacity, done ſome little Services to my King, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and Holy Religion, ſo I might by GOD's Bleſſing prove Inſtrumental at this Seaſon, to beget a good Underſtanding betwixt contending Parties.</p>
            <p>I thank GOD for it, I have hitherto Laboured with ſome good Succeſs, I find diverſe Pious and Learned Men amongſt my <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren, I find fellow Mourners for the Diſtreſſes of Our Zion, I find his Grace my Lord Commiſſioner, deſerves higher Characters than all the Eloquence I could command, has as yet given him, I find he is not to be taught Manners by the Author of the Reflections, and that he does not think it unworthy of his while, or Serious Thoughts, amidſt all the important Cares he is loaden with, to liſten to the Friendly and privat Conferences of Men of different Perſwaſions in little Matters; The King himſelf finds Leaſure &amp; Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, amidſt the rugged Toils of Warr, to regrat Our unkindly and unſeaſonable Contentions, and he wiſhes them at an end; And there are more of his chief Miniſters than one, who deſign to ſerve GOD Faithfully, and their Royal Maſter, and their afflicted Countrey therein.</p>
            <p>I want not overtures of Peace and Union, ſuch as the Generality of this Nation, or at leaſt, thoſe whoſe Hearts GOD hath touched, ſhall in time be well pleaſed with; I ſeek Peace and purſue it, and there are on both ſides, who join cordially their Helping Hands to me, I expect a fair Conference and a good Iſſue through the Bleſſing of GOD on it, and I Labour without Wearieneſs to have all things Right diſpoſed to that Effect; And I will not be interrupted by the nameleſs Scribler, but <hi>I</hi> can and will Pray heartily, That GOD may inſpire him with a more Chriſtian and Charitable Temper.</p>

            <p>Laſt Seſſion of Parliament we were called to account upon that head, and upon a very miſtaken Suppoſition (proceeding from partial information) that We had been acted by a principle of Enmity to the Civil Government, and influenced by Great Men ill affected to it, two or three were cenſured, and the reſt overlookt by the Mildneſs of the King and Parliament.</p>
